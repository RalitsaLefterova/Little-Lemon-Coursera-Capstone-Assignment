## About The Project

Demo: [Little Lemon](https://example.com)

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The 'Little Lemon Website' is a web development project created as a part of the 'Front-End Developer Capstone' course on Coursera. It represents a delightful online platform showcasing the flavors of Mediterranean cuisine. One of its features is the convenient online reservation system, that allows guests to effortlessly book a table for an unforgettable dining experience.

Introduction: Little Lemon is a Mediterranean eatery, owned and operated by a close-knit family. We pride ourselves on infusing traditional Mediterranean recipes with contemporary flair, offering our patrons a one-of-a-kind dining adventure through the flavors of the Mediterranean.

Task Overview: Our assignment entails crafting a modern and adaptable front-end interface for the Little Lemon application. A key addition to our task is integrating a bookings feature, enhancing the functionality of the app. Additionally, we are tasked with writing comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability of the system and creating design wireframes and prototypes using Figma to guide the development process.

Please note: Currently, the only functioning feature on this website is the 'Reserve a Table' function. The 'LogIn', 'Menu', and 'Online Order' functionalities are not essential for the assignment and are under construction. Temporary 'under construction' images are displayed on those pages.

<!-- In addition to our online reservation system, our website provides a tantalizing glimpse into our menu, featuring an array of Mediterranean-inspired dishes crafted with the freshest ingredients and traditional recipes. From savory appetizers to mouthwatering entrees and decadent desserts, each dish is prepared with care and passion, capturing the essence of Mediterranean flavors. -->

## Design Process

During the development of the 'Little Lemon Website', I invested time in creating comprehensive wireframes and prototypes to visualize the layout and functionality of the website. These wireframes and prototypes were created using Figma, a collaborative design tool that allowed for seamless iteration and refinement of the website's design.

### Wireframes

I began the design process by sketching rough wireframes to outline the basic structure and flow of the website. These wireframes served as a blueprint for the layout of each page, helping to ensure a clear and intuitive user experience.

### Prototypes

Once the wireframes were finalized, I transitioned to creating interactive prototypes in Figma. These prototypes provided a more detailed representation of the website's functionality, allowing for user interaction and navigation through the various pages and features.

### Figma Project

Screenshots of the wireframes and prototypes created in Figma are provided below. For a more interactive experience, you can access the full Figma project by following the link provided.
